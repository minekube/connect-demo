# Minekube Connect Demo

Minekube Connect Demo is a tiny open source demo implementation of
[Minekube Connect](https://developers.minekube.com/connect/).


Minekube Connect Demo allows you to connect any Minecraft server,
whether online mode, public, behind your protected home network or
anywhere else in the world, with our hosted demo implementation.

The demo provides a working Connect network (Watch and Tunnel service)
running on a single Gate instance
as [implemented here](https://github.com/minekube/gate/blob/master/pkg/util/connectutil/single/single.go).

## Getting Started

1. Install the Connect Java plugin on your Minecraft server or proxy
2. Start and join your server publicly at `<server>.demo.minekube.net`
